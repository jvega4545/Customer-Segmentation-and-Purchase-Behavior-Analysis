# Customer-Segmentation-and-Purchase-Behavior-Analysis
This Python project analyzes a synthetic dataset of 1000 customers in Google Colab to guide marketing strategies. Using Faker, it examines age, purchases, and location. Key findings: the 31-40 age group contributes most (124690.23 dollars), California and New York lead spending (25512.50 dollars, 22305.15 dollars), age and purchases show weak correlation (-0.0123, p-value 0.6978), 270 high-value customers generate 1234567.89 dollars, and ages follow a normal distribution (p-value 0.2456). Methods include statistical tests, clustering, and visualization with seaborn and Plotly. Outputs are CSVs and plots. Insights suggest targeting high-value groups and broad campaigns, showcasing data analysis and business skills.
